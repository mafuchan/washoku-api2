'• 4 Pork chops
• 1 cup flour
• 2 cups panko or bread crumbs
• 1 tsp. salt
• 1 tsp. ground black pepper
• 1 egg, beaten
• Canola oil, enough to fry in
• 2-3 leaves Napa cabbage, shredded finely
Tonkatsu sauce or ketchup mixed with worcestershire sauce',
'Trim pork of any fat. If the pieces are too thick, flatten with a frying pan or the flat side of a meat tenderizer. Mix together the flour, salt and pepper, and place in a bowl that is large enough to hold 1 piece of the pork. Beat the egg till it is the consistency for scrambled eggs and place in another bowl. Have panko on hand in another bowl as well.

Dredge the pork in the flour mixture, making sure the pork is completely covered. Then, dredge in the egg bath and finally in the panko. Make sure to get as much of the pork covered in panko. Heat the canola oil to 320 F and add the pork in 2 at a time. Fry them on each side for a few minutes or until a golden brown. Remove from the oil and place on paper towels to absorb any excess grease. Let cool and slice into small to medium strips.

Serve with the shredded napa cabbage and tonkatsu sauce. If you do not have tonkatsu sauce, mix the ketchup and worcestershire to taste. Should have a tangy hint of worcestershire, while still retaining the ketchup flavor.',

Never boil your miso broth once the miso has been added, this will break down the miso and cause the soup to be grainy.',
